\centerline{A proof of the existence of the regular icosahedron.}


Let $\lambda > 1$ be a real number, and consider the set $X$ 
consisting of the 12 vectors 
$$(0,\pm 1,\pm\lambda), \qquad 
(\pm 1,\pm\lambda,0), \qquad 
(\pm\lambda,0,\pm 1).$$ 
Let $G$ be the group of symmetries of the set $X$, or equivalently 
of its convex hull in $\R^3$.  
For any choice of $\lambda$, show that 24 divides $|G|$, and 
show that $G$ acts transitively on $X$.  (Hint: 
find a subgroup of $G$ of order 8 and another subgroup of $G$ of 
order 3.)  

Find all possible dot products $\vv.\ww$ for $\vv,\ww\in X$.  
(Hint: since you have already shown that $G$ acts 
transitively on $X$, it suffices to fix one particular choice of
$\vv$.)  Check that for each $\vv\in X$, there are five distinct 
vectors $\ww\in X - \{\vv\}$ such 
that $\vv.\ww>0$.  Call these 5 $\ww$ the set $N_\vv$ of neighbours of
$\vv$.  Find a value for $\lambda$ for which all of the products 
$\vv.\ww$ for $\ww\in N_\vv$ are equal.  For this value of $\lambda$, 
show that the elements of $N_\vv$ form a regular pentagon lying in a 
plane orthogonal to $\vv$, whose centre lies on the line $t\vv$.  
Deduce that for this particular value of $\lambda$, the group $G$ 
contains an element of order 5, and hence $|G| \geq 120$, the order 
of the group of symmetries of the regular icosahedron.
